# Intro To IAM 

This lecture is focused on working with the IAM service and we will be covering the following topics:

- using IAM to create users
- using IAM to create groups
- adding users to groups

## Prerequisites

- An AWS (Amazon Web Services) account
- A Credit card is required to verify your AWS account.

If you do not have an account, open AWS and click Create a Free Account. Amazon provides a free tier, with some limitations, for twelve months after you sign-up for an AWS account.

## Creating User/Groups Using IAM

The first service we will use is **IAM**, which stands for **Identity and Access Management**.  It is used for managing user and group accounts, along with creating roles and policies in AWS.  

The one golden rule to follow is that we should never use the **Root** account when connecting to AWS and for that reason  we will create a separate admin account and assign it the appropriate permissions. 

Creating an account involves the following steps:

- Defining a user name and the type of access
- Adding the user to a group and assigning group permissions

AWS has made it easy to search for a service by using typing in the service name, in this case **IAM**.

### Creating A User

Once the tool opens let's click on **Users** and the **Add User** button.

Create a **User name** and choose both **Programatic access** and **AWS Management Console access**.  This access allows the user to connect to both the AWS console and from their local terminal. 

For user accounts not your own leave the **Autogenerated password** and **Require password reset** options selected

Once complete click **Next: Permissions** to assign the user to a group. 

### Creating A Group

Groups are a key part to security in AWS and, by default, there are no predefined groups so we will need to create one. 

Click on the **Create group** button.

Let's call the group **seir-admins** and assign the the **AdministratorAccess** policy. 

AWS uses policies to define permissions and are used for not only user accounts but for **roles** as well.

Once the group is created AWS will have now automatically add the user the newly created group.

We have the option to assign tags to this user but we will not do so at this time so click **Next**.  Tags are a great way to group resources that have some relationship, such as those used to support a specific app or department. 

Verify user account and click on **Create user**.

### Notify User

On the review page we can see that the user has been assigned an **Access key id**, **Secret access key** and a **Password**.  

There is also a **Download.csv** button which contains some of this info so **click** the button to download the file. 

**Send Email**

Now click **Send email** and email your self the confirmation email. This isn't required but you will be creating an admin user accounts for the instructional team as well so it's good practice for now. 

Include the **Download.csv** file as an attachment in the email.

Open the csv file and confirm that it includes the **user name**, **password** and **console login link**.

One piece of info we will need for the user to login in the **12 digit** account number associated with the root account.  You can find this in AWS by clicking the drop down for your account on the top right side of the nav.

#### Login As An IAM User

Once you have copied that number and/or written it down click on the **Console login link** in the csv file and this will take you to the login page.

Since we want to sign in as the new **IAM user** we just created click on that box.

Enter the **12 digit account number** and click next.  Here you will be be able to login as the **IAM user**.  Login with the account name and the password provided in the csv file.

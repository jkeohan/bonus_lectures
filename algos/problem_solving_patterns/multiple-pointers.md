## Multiple Pointers

The multiple pointers approach uses separate pointers that correspond to index positions and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on specific conditions.

### Starter Code

Here is the [Starter Code](https://replit.com/@jkeohan/Algo-Multiple-Pointers-Starter#index.js).

### Looping Approaches

We can make use of the following looping techniques to solve an algorithmic problem using the multiple pointer approach. 

- double nested for loops 
- single while loop 

We will first take a look at a double nested for loop. 

### Nested For Loops

Let's say we needed to loop over an array and keep the nested loop(**j**) one position ahead of first loop(**i**) the entire time.  

In this case our multiple pointers are **j** and **i**. 

```js
let arr = [1,2,3]
//   initialize   condition    increment
for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1){
    for(let j = i + 1; j < arr.length-1; j += 1) {
        console.log(arr[i], arr[j])
    }
}

=> 1 2
=> 1 3
=> 2 3
```

This type of approach is called **brute force** as you are forcing every combination until the solution is found. Taking this nested looping approach will mean our solution has a time efficiency of **O(n^2)** or Quadratic Time. 

### Single While Loop

We can also create multiple pointers and use a single **while loop** to produce the same output.  This will improve the time efficiency to **O(n)** or Linear Time. 

```js
let arr = [1,2,3]
let i = 0
let j = i + 1

while(i < arr.length - 1){
  if(j < arr.length) {
      console.log(arr[i], arr[j])
      j++
  } else {
    i++
    j = i + 1
  }
}

=> 1 2
=> 1 3
=> 2 3
```

Let's apply the **brute force** method and a slight variation of the above **while** loop to solve an algo that requires finding two numbers that add to a target number.  

### Solving sumZero

The algo accepts a sorted array of integers and returns either an array of the first pair that sum to 0 or an empty array.  Keep in mind that this specific solution does **require** that the array first be sorted. 

```js
sumZero([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, -3]) // [-3, 3]
sumZero([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]) // [-2, 2]
sumZero([-2, -1, 0, 4, 5]) // []
```

#### Double Nested Loop Solution

The brute force way of solving this would be to add the value in the first loop(**i**) with each subsequent value of nested loop(**j**) until we find a pair that sums to 0.  

Here is a good first step in trying to visualize each step performed by the algo.

```
INDEX:   1   2   3   4   5
VALUE:  -2, -1,  0, 1,  2
         i
             j
       
       i    j
sum = -2 + -1 = -3
sum = -2 +  0 = -2
sum = -2 +  1 = -1
sum = -2 +  2 =  0
```

Of course we should define those steps above as pseudocode before we write any actual code. 

```
LOOP over the array length SETTING i = 0
 LOOP over the array length SETTING j = i + 1
  IF arr[i] + arr[j] === 0
   RETURN an array of those two values ([arr[left], arr[right]])
  END IF
 END LOOP
END LOOP
RETURN empty array
```

With our pseudocode in place let's write the code. 

```js
function sumZero(arr){
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1){
    for(let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j += 1){
      if(arr[i] + arr[j] === 0){
        return [arr[i], arr[j]]
      }
    }
  }
  return []
}
```

#### Single Loop Solution

The above solution does indeed solve the algo using multiple pointers however it has a time efficiency of O(n^2).  If we take a simple loop approach we can increase the time efficiency to O(n).

One slight difference in this approach will be to position the pointers at opposite ends of the array with each one working their way towards the middle.  

If ever **left** exceeds **right** then we know there is no possible solution and we will use that logic to terminate the loop.  

```
INDEX:   0   1   2   3   4  5
ELEM:   -2  -1   0   1   2  3
         l
                            r

sum = -2 + 3 = 1
sum = -2 + 2 = 0
```

Of course we should define those steps above as pseudocode before we write any actual code. 

```
SET a variable called left to 0
SET a variable called right to the length of the array - 1
WHILE left < right
    SET sum to adding the arr[left] + arr[right]
    IF sum = 0
        RETURN an array of those two values ([arr[left], arr[right]])
    ELSE IF sum > 0
        DECREASE right by 1
    ELSE 
        INCREASE left by 1
    END IF
END WHILE
RETURN empty array
```

Here is a solution that uses a single while loop and has a time complexity of O(n).

```js
let arr = [-2, -1,  0,  1,  2, 3]

function sumZero(arr){
  let left = 0
  let right = arr.length-1
  while(left < right){
    let sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
    if(sum === 0){
      return [arr[left], arr[right]]
    } else if(sum > 0){
       right -= 1
    } else {
      left += 1
    }
  }
  return []
}

```

#### :alarm_clock: - Activity - Solving TwoSum - 15min

Given an sorted array of positive integers and a target number, return a new array that contains the first 2 numbers from the input array that, if added, would be the sum of the target number.

```js
  let numsArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
  twoSum(numsArr, 9) // returns [1,8]
  twoSum(numsArr, 4) // returns [1,3]
```

### Solving insertionSort

**InsertionSort** is one of the 3 basic sorting algos.  The other two are **bubble** and **selection** sort.  All three of these sorting algos make use of multiple pointers and does so in a very unique.   **j** starts one position behind **i** and when **j** finds a value that is less than the value at **i** it decrements until it finds the proper position to place the element in the correct order. 

Here are the starting positions for both **i** and **j** and some additional pseudocode to help work through the problem. 

```
INDEX:   -1  0  1  2
ELEM:        3  2  1
                i       cur = 2
             j
```

Of course we should define those steps above as pseudocode before we write any actual code. 

```
LOOP over the array in ascending order SETTING i = 1
 SET a var called cur to the element at position i
 LOOP over the array in descending order SETTING j = i - 1
  IF j > -1 AND arr[j] > cur
    SET arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
  END IF
 END LOOP
    SET arr[j+1] = cur
END LOOP
RETURN arr
```

#### Brute Force Solution

Here is the solution using a double nested for loop. 

```js
function insertionSort(arr){
  for(let i = 1; i < arr.length; i += 1){
    let cur = arr[i]
    for(var j = i - 1; arr[j] > cur && j > -1; j -= 1){
      arr[j+1] = arr[j]
    }
    arr[j+1] = cur
  }
  return arr
}
```

#### Single Loop Solution

Let's refactor and implement a single loop which will reduce the time complexity as before. 


```js
function insertionSort(arr){
  let i = 1
  let j = i - 1
  let cur = arr[1];
  while(i < arr.length){
    if(j > -1 && arr[j] > cur) {
         arr[j+1] = arr[j]
        j--
    } else {
      arr[j+1] = cur
      i++
      j = i - 1
      cur = arr[i]
    }
 } 
 return arr
}
```

## Challenge - CountingDuplicates

Solve the **countingDuplicates** algo using both a double nested for loop and a single loop. 

The function will take in a sorted array of numbers and will return the number of unique values it finds in the array. 

```js
countUniqueValues([1,1,2,2,3]) => 3
countUniqueValues([1,1,2,2,3,5]) => 4
```

### Bonus - CountingDuplicates

Refactor the code so that it would also place the unique values in order as it finds them and returns only the unique values. 

```js
countUniqueValues([1,1,2,2,3]) => [1,2,3]
countUniqueValues([1,1,2,2,3,5]) => [1,2,3,5]
```
